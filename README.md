### Overview

Farmer's Delight is a mod focused on providing solid cooking mechanics and extending the different forms of farming in the game. The goal is to add only a gentle amount of new content to farm and collect, instead focusing on giving more purpose to existing items and blocks that would otherwise pass under the player's radar.

This mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:
- Backup your saves often;
- Don't add it to released modpacks yet;
- Report any issues you find to our issue tracker!
