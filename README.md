# Farmer's Delight

A lightweight farming expansion for Minecraft.

Farmer's Delight is a mod focused on providing solid cooking mechanics and extending the different forms of farming in the game. The goal is to add only a gentle amount of new content to farm and collect, and focus on giving more purpose to existing items and blocks that would otherwise pass under the player's radar.

This mod is currently under development, and isn't yet feature-complete. Quite a few other features are planned to be added, so keep an eye on it as we post more updates!

Thank you for visiting the repository! If you'd like to contribute with the mod, feel free to check the issues page - whether to open a new one or give existing ones a shot. All help is appreciated!
